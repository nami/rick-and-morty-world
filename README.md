This project was part of a technical coding challenge for a front end position. There were four parts to the challenge, and each challenge was requested to be submitted in seperate PRs.

## Challenge #1 - Rick & Morty Content

Using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) the tasks were to display some information. 

- The home page lists all the locations of Rick & Morty
- When clicking a location, all associated characters are listed with their names and status (Dead or Alive)
- When clicking on the character name, user is redirected to character page

### Images

Location images were from [here](https://wallpaperaccess.com/rick-and-morty)

##### From left to right: Homepage, Character List, Character Profile

### Tech
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & Hooks
- Axios for the APIs
- Bulma CSS
- React-Router

---

## Challenge #2 - PWA

Project was made into a PWA and tested with Lighthouse.

Static content was cached via custom service worker. Locations and characters were cached using IndexedDB (In `locations.js` and `character.js` in the `components` folder)

Service worker was registered in `index.js` in `src` folder

### Tech
- A customised service worker (`serviceworker.js` in the `public` folder)
- Dexie (React wrapper for IndexedDB)
- `Offline.html` in `public` folder for when user accessed with no internet connection 

---

## Challenge #3 - Micro-Interactions

To improve UI/UX, I added:
- Animations when first locations and the character list for each location
- Loading placeholders for locations and characters
- Lazy loading for a smoother and faster interaction

### Tech
- animate.css(https://animate.style/)
- React loading skeleton(https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton)
- React LazyLoad(https://github.com/twobin/react-lazyload)

#### Note
Technically, lazing loading could also be a point in the fourth challenge, but I thought it was an important part of the UI experience.

## Challenge #4 - Performance and wrap-it up

#### Lighthouse Score
After cleaning up a few files and trimming some bits, the final score is between 90 to 94 for performance and 100s for the rest:

#### Deploying
The app was deployed to firebase using the Command Line. It is available at https://rick-and-morty-world.web.app/

#### Testing
Unfortunately, testing is not my strong suite. So I did some snapshot testing with Jest and React Test Renderer.

### Tech
- Jest
- Enzyme
- React Test Renderer

Thanks for reading to the end! This was a fun challenge!
